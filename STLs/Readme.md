All parts can be printed without support. Keep the orientation for best results.
You should not use PLA (as the enclosure can get quite warm and PLa deforms pretty easily. And yes, I printed the filter in PLA and it deformed a lot).
Instead, use PETG, ABS, ASA, etc. I used esun ABS+ (black and fire engine red).

See main README for print instruction.
